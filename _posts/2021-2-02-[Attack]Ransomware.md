# Ransomware
* Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to the infected computer system, and demands that the user pays a ransom to the attacker to remove the restriction.
* Some forms of ransomware encrypt files on the systemâ€™s local storage, which become almost impossible to decrypt without paying the ransom for the decryption key; while some may simply lock the system and display messages intended to coax the user into paying
* Ransomware can be classified into two classes: Class A ransomware overwrites the contents of the original file, so the deleted file cannot be restored. 
* In this class, encrypted filenames are the same as the original ones. 
* Class B ransomware makes another encrypted file (for example, B.txt.crypt) using the original file then deletes the original file after encryption. 
* The encrypted files have other file extensions and sometimes the original files can be restored because they are not overwritten. Class B ransomware is easy to detect because files having a specific file extension are created. 
* Whereas, class A is more serious because the original files cannot be restored in practice, so we will concentrate on class A ransomware in this study.
