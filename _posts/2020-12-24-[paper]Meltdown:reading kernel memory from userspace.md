## Out of oreder excution
* In practice, CPUs supporting out-of-order execution allow running operations **speculatively** to the extent that the processor's out-of-order logic processess instructions before the CPU is certain that the instruction will be needed and committed.
* In this paper, we refer to speculative execution in a more restricted meaning, where it refers to an instruction sequence following a branch, and use the term out of order execution to refer to any way of getting an operation executed before the processor has committed the results of all prior instructions
